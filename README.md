## Project Background
Our team always enjoyed playing games like Kahoot in school. The idea that you have to know the material well in order to win was always a motivating factor to pay attention in. We wanted to make something to Kahoot but with a twist.

## Brief Project Description
Tic-tac-math is a website that allows two players to play a game of tic-tac-toe. However, there's a twist. In order for a player to put their X or O on the board, they need to answer a randomly generated multiplication problem with the correct answer!
